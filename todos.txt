1- do all bus start from the school? should we add flexability to the starting points?
2- total travel time assumptions: over-estimate vs under-estimate? does it affect / is related to a* part?
currently we are over estimating (at least from the test points so far) compared to the gMaps
estimate at the evening.

this matter more i think when we had the fixed route level Tmax not per student, since in route level Tmax
we break up the route or not accept more students in the route when we reach Tmax.

if we overestimate: we may not take in students we otherwise couldve packed into the route, decreasing the effiency
if we underestimate: we may produce a route that takes longer in reality than the route's Tmax, leading to an unfeasible solution
when it comes to satisying the constraints (not sure how we would deal with that if we had a sort of retry mechanism)

but since we eleminate route level tMax and instead compare between direct time to school given our formulas for calculating time 
vs time since boarding the bus it makes the actual value of the time estimate less relevant when it comes to route packing effiency(?)
